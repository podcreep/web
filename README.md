# Podcreep Web

Main AngularTS website for podcreep.

## Development server

You first need to be running the backend on localhost:8080 (see https://github.com/podcreep/server
for details on how to do that).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically
reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
